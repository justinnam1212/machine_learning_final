Fall 2022 Machine Learning Final Project - Animal Image Classification

Our code usually runs just by running the cells sequentially, but unfortunately the data import relies on the data being held in the user's Google Drive. 

The files are quite large and thus we are working on uploading them to GitHub, but they are not up at this time.

In some of the cells we load in a model state from a mounted Drive as well.

The link to the files and the model states is here if they are needed: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TRmypOU2wwILSsad4CuG_wZTkdgVkOP-?usp=share_link
